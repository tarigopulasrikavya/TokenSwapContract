Token Swap Contract
Project Title
Token Swap Contract - A Simple 1:1 Token Exchange Mechanism on Aptos

Project Description
This project implements a basic decentralized token swap mechanism on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to exchange tokens at a fixed 1:1 ratio. The smart contract provides a simple and secure way for users to swap between two different token types through a liquidity pool system. Users can create swap pools with initial liquidity and perform token exchanges seamlessly.

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a foundational building block for decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Aptos ecosystem by providing a simple, secure, and efficient token swapping mechanism. We aim to:

Democratize Token Exchange: Enable anyone to create and participate in token swaps without intermediaries
Foster Innovation: Provide a base template that developers can extend for more complex DeFi applications
Enhance Liquidity: Create multiple swap pools that increase overall token liquidity in the Aptos ecosystem
Promote Accessibility: Offer a user-friendly interface for token swapping that doesn't require deep technical knowledge
Key Features
üîÑ Simple 1:1 Swap Mechanism
